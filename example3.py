# This program demonstrates how to print a string
# a string that contains special characters in python
# for example, the "double quote" or "
# to escape python from interpretting the double quote and to let it
# print it, use the 'backslash' \
# in this case, the backslash is called an 'escape' character

# other special characters escaped in this example are the \ itself (use 2 \\) and new line

# \" = " \\ = \ \n = new line \t = tab
