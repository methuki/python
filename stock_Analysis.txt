Fundemental Stock Measurments

1. Cash Flow
Number of shares outstandinig

* Show what we are paying for the cash flow               
                                                     "Current Assets are
                                                       three times CLS."    
                                                
                                                        
2. Current Ratio                          
                                  300,000
Current Assets                    100,000      
Current Liabilities                       3:1

Assets = Everthing the company owns
Current assets = Things that are use up frequently
Liabilities - Everything it owns
Current liabilities = Due within one year

*Look for companies with at least 2:1

3. Divident Yield

Amount   Annual cash Divident
         Current Price

* Show the moving price ( Because the
divident is ( most of the time ) constant)

4. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

   Company Earnings
   Number of shares outstanding

* Reported either last quarter or last year

(Usually $1 - $5 , Spikes $10 - $20 , minus when losing.)

* Subject to maniputation and market pressure.

Earnings momentum (Earning Acceleration)
	"The big mo"
		--> to identify Growth companies
Earnings Surprises = rise and fall sharply

page 193(Nearest Guid)
Revenue(Top Line) = Gross Sales = Income
Total Revenue - Total Cost = Gross Profit
	99,870 - 53,857 = 46,013

  Gross Profit - Expences , income tax = Net Income
46.013 - 31,181      = 14,832

Earnings Per Share = Net Income      14,833,000,000
		     Number of share 1,268,789,202 

5. Net Profit Margin

    Money left after expences
    Money left before expences

Before   1,000,000
	   700,000
Expence
After = 1,000,000 - 700,000 = 300,000


Less expences makes the margin go higher
***
High profit margin tell you - Good Management
			    They survive the compition
					within the industry

6. Price / Book Ratio
		Stocks price
    (Stock holdings  		Stocks Worth (Book Value)
      equity)
Book Value - Company Value ( Office space telip
	     Number of Shares Outstanding   ect....)



7. Price / Earnings Ratio (P/E or Multiple)

	Price
	Earnings

Trailing P/E = Past 12 months

Forward P/E = Next year (Analyst)

to see if the stock is selling for a good price.
(Put the price in context with company
earnings.
	 lesser the price.
high P/E - Riskier
Low P/E - Slow growth companies

Mature companies w/ low P/E pay Dividents

New Companies w/ high P/E P?E do not

8. Price / Sales Ratio  (P/S or PSR)


	Total Market Value
     Most Recent 4 Quater Sales Revenue

		or
	Price Per Share
	Sales Per Share

eg. if shares outstanding = 10
current price = $400
then Total market value = $4,000	(10 ร 400)
if Sales = 10,000
then Sales per Share = 1,000		(10,000 รท 10)

			รท   40


9. Price / Cash - Flow Ratio (P/CF)

if cash flow = $80
price = $400
then P/CF = 800 = 10
	     80  
Cash flow yeild = 80 / 800 - 0.10(10 %)

10. Retern On Equity  (ROG)


	Net Income
	Total Shares Holders Equity

* Bigger = Better
* The company in making lot of money off the investments that shareholder have made

29% in a good ROE

Apple computer 1995 - 424 รท 2901 = 15%
		net income     Share holders equity

1996	income		      - 816   =  -40%

ipod 2006 - 23%
     2008 - 27%
     2011 - 42%     (25.9 billion)
